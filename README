HOW TO USE

Compile using:
make arith

run with:
a) compression
./arith -c "file_to_be_compressed.ppm" > "decompressed_file.ppm"

b) decompression
./arith -d "file_to_be_decompressed.ppm" > "compressed_file.ppm"

NOTE: PPM stands for Portable Pixmap Format.Although these files are rare these days, you can spot one by looking out for the . PPM extension. The PPM 
format emerged in the late 1980s to make sharing images between different platforms easier as they rely on r,g,b values which are easier to manipulate.

Description:
Arith is an image compression/decompression algorithm that runs on C. It makes use of bitpacking, quantization, as well as discrete cosine transformations.
A ppm is fed in to the compressor, which it converts into a specific compressed format where every 4 bytes in the file are converted to 1 byte. The 
decompressor takes in a file of this certain format and converts it into a regular ppm file. The size saved is a lot because 4 bytes are converted into 
one and for really bbig images this is very effective.
